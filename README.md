# Final Project

After learning many of the skills required of a web developer, you will over the next six weeks consolidate those
 lessons into a portfolio piece.

## Architecture

The outcome of this project is a web application, that will consist of:

- A [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) built using [Express](https://expressjs.com), persisting data in [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com).
- A [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) built with client-side rendering using [React](https://reactjs.org/), that consumes said REST API.

## Methodology

The project will be built over multiple [iterations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design). A goal of
iterative design is to have a functional application at each stage, adding features incrementally. The application
should not include visible, partially implemented features. Each iteration should be complete, and able to show as
part of a portfolio piece.

Iterations are a staple of modern software development.

Feature requests will be provided as high-level descriptions called [job stories](https://jtbd.info/5-tips-for-writing-a-job-story-7c9092911fc9). These stories will not define
an exact implementation, but instead a user's needs.

You will use these stories to design your data model, and APIs.

You will also receive high-level wireframes

## Iterations

1. [Viewing sustainable alternatives](./iteration1.md).
2. [Finding products near you](./iteration2.md).
3. [Users can comment on products](./iteration3.md).
