# Iteration 2 - APIs and integrations

## Stories
When I have decided to get an alternative, I can find which alternative products are sold locally, so that I know what
my options are.

When I have decided to buy a specific product, I can find the exact place where I can buy that product, so that I don't
give up and buy whatever is most convenient.

When I know which places I can buy the product, I can explore which place is most convenient for me to purchase the good
from, so that I am more likely to make the sustainable choice.

## Data Source
An external product listing API that includes product and store location information will be provided. Your Node.js
application will query the API based on the data model you introduced in the first iteration.

## Week 1
- Devise a scheme for querying the API using your existing data model. How will you map from your data model to the
 product API? What problems does the API pose? Document your thought processes around this. Integrating with APIs is
hard work and these lessons are great resources for interviews.
- A proof-of-concept implementation of your integration.

## Week 2
- Implemented integration with product API.
- Able to view products related to categories found last week.

## Outcome
An interactive application for exploring alternatives and products that are near me.
