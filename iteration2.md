# Iteration 2

## Stories
When I have decided to get an alternative, I can find which alternative products are sold locally, so that I know what
my options are.

When I have decided to buy a specific product, I can find the exact place where I can buy that product, so that I don't
give up and buy whatever is most convenient.

When I know which places I can buy the product, I can explore which place is most convenient for me to purchase the good
from, so that I am more likely to make the sustainable choice.

## Week 1
- A revised data model based on the requirements above.
- New REST APIs for serving the data needed for the features described above.

## Week 2
 - Initial implementation of Google Maps integration for exploring alternative products.

## Outcome
An interactive application for exploring alternatives and products that are near me.
