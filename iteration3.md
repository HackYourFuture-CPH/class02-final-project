# Iteration 3 - Google Maps Integration

## Stories

When I have decided to get an alternative, I can find which alternative products are sold locally, so that I know what my options are.

When I know which places I can buy the product, I can explore which place is most convenient for me to purchase the good from, so that I am more likely to make the sustainable choice.

## Suggested course of action

### Week 1
Familiarize yourself with the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), maybe try out some of the tutorials and use the knowledge to implement a map view in your application. Browsers have a fairly simple [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation) that can be used to fetch the users current location (if available). Set the map to center around the position of the user and provide a sensible default if the user does not provide access to location.
Figure out how to mark up elements on the map so you can place a "pin" where there is a store. Implement the needed map overlays to be able to show the relevant data about the store on the map.

### Week 2
This is the last week of the project. You will most likely have some spillover from the previous weeks. Focus on eliminating bugs and finishing up feature implemented in the previous weeks. Even without any dedicated tasks you should expect to be very busy this week.

## Outcome
An interactive application complete with map integration allowing you to explore alternative products nearby.
