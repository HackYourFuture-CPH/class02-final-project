# Iteration 1

## Stories
When I want to buy something, I can find sustainable alternatives, so that I can make an informed, sustainable choice..

When Iâ€™ve found alternatives, I can compare their relative environmental impacts to one another, so that I can understand which is the best choice.

## Week 1
Produce a data model and SQL schemas based on the features listed above.

## Week 2
Integrate the data model and API with a client-side application that provides browsing functionality. This
can be search or just listing. Up to you.

## Outcome

An application with the architecture described in the main [README.md](./README.md) that provides the features above.
Simple lists and searching of alternatives. No need to provide concrete products at this time.
